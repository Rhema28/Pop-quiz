# Bible Challenge  

Bible Challenge is a fun and engaging pop quiz site that promotes an eyecatching and stimulating questionnaire that players can use to not only improve on their biblical theory but also enjoy to keep their minds engaged on short trips as opposed to constantly scrolling through social media. It hopes to challenge, motivate and educate players to grow in the knowledge of Biblical truths and encourage them to be motivated to study their bible more in order to pass the quiz successfully.  

The Bible Quiz will be a great, fun start for those who are interested in learning more about God. Those that already know about God, can use it to challenge themselves to remember specific verses of scripture and adopt a habit of constantly having God and His word on their mind.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea that can be implemented to this site is a score tracker

- Also a competitive aspect would be nice so that multiple users could compete against each other in the quiz

- A timer could also be introduced that could determine the level of each player; slow pace for beginners, medium pace for intermediate, fast pace for advanced

- A sign up page to collect data like name and email address from players would be a nice touch

- Furthermore, a unique congratulatory message could then be added at the end by using the sign up data, that mentions the user's name.
